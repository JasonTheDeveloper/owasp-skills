## Cross-reference matrix

Each vulnerability document follows a consistent structure:

1. Description — what the vulnerability is and how it manifests in internal infrastructure.
2. Risk — concrete consequences of exploitation and business impact.
3. Vulnerability checklist — indicators that the environment is exposed.
4. Prevention controls — defensive measures and rectification steps.
5. Example attack scenarios — realistic exploitation narratives.
6. Detection guidance — signals and methods to identify exposure.
7. Remediation steps — immediate and long-term actions to contain and resolve.
