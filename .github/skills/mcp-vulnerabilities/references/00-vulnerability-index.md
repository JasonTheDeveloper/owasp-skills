## Cross-reference matrix

Each vulnerability document follows a consistent structure:

1. Description — what the vulnerability is and why it matters in MCP contexts.
2. Impact — concrete consequences of exploitation.
3. Vulnerability checklist — indicators that the environment is exposed.
4. Prevention controls — defensive design patterns and governance.
5. Example attack scenarios — realistic exploitation narratives.
6. Detection guidance — signals and indicators of compromise.
7. Remediation steps — immediate actions to contain and resolve.
