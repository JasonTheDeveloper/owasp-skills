# CI/CD Vulnerabilities — Skill Entry

This `SKILL.md` is the **entrypoint** for the CI/CD Vulnerabilities skill.

The skill encodes the **OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks** as structured, machine-readable references
that an agent can query to identify, assess, and remediate CI/CD pipeline security risks.
