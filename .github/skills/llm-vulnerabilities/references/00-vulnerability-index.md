Each vulnerability document follows a consistent structure:

1. Description — what the vulnerability is and how it manifests in LLM systems.
2. Common examples — typical patterns that expose the vulnerability.
3. Attack scenarios — realistic exploitation narratives.
4. Prevention and mitigation — defensive measures and remediation steps.
5. References — external sources, research, and related frameworks.
